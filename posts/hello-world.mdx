## Problem:



Despite the intentions and resolve to move towards a more cleaner world, both businesses and governments struggle to make meaningful progress that can be quantified. 
This happens due to a lack of real-time insights from day-to-day operations for businesses and due to a lack of standardization for regulators to benchmark.
---------------------------------------
## Solution:

We believe the above is fundamentally a data problem. Using ZeroEntropy, built on top of Snowflake as the data platform, the following features will be provided to solve the problem:

Data management: collect, store, and manage both structured and unstructured data related to greenhouse gas emissions from various sources such as energy usage, transportation, manufacturing, waste management, sensors, IOT devices, supply chain entities, raw materials used and so on
Calculation and Reporting:  Calculate greenhouse gas emissions and generate reports that are compliant with regulatory requirements and industry standards, such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
Customizable emissions factors: Allow the user to input their own emissions factors or to choose from a library of pre-defined factors to ensure accurate emission calculations.
Tracking and monitoring: Allow users to track and monitor their greenhouse gas emissions over time to identify areas of improvement and track progress toward emissions reduction goals.
Scenario analysis: Allow users to perform "What-if" scenario analysis to assess the potential impact of changes in emissions sources or reduction strategies.
Integration with other systems: Provide ability to integrate with other systems such as accounting, energy management, and supply chain management to give a comprehensive view of greenhouse gas emissions across the organization.
User-friendly interface: will be easy to navigate, with intuitive features and clear instructions for data input and report generation.
Collaboration and sharing:  With snowflake as an underneath data platform, collaboration and sharing of data and reports among different departments or stakeholders within an organization should be possible; as well as with external stakeholders such as customers, suppliers, and regulators.

## Competitive advantage:

ZeroEntropy can become the de-facto app for greenhouse gas management among industries, regulators, and carbon credit exchanges. The rich set of highly effective and desirable features with a focus on the customer's highest priority requirements can make the application highly integrated with the daily operations of the business making it difficult to switch to something else. Also, with the help of a common versatile data-platform like Snowflake combined with the extensibility of the features of the application across different companies within an industry as well as across industries due to the global and urgent nature of the carbon emission problem can induce strong network effects.

## Size of opportunity: 
The global emission management software market size was valued at $10.4 billion in 2020, and is projected to reach $43.6 billion by 2030, registering a CAGR of 15.7% from 2021 to 2030.
